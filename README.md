# lang
LaNG: LaNG is Not a lanGuage

# what is this
My pet project for learning how to implement a programming language.
I'm following the Î»anguage tutorial (http://lisperator.net/pltut/), but implementing everything in Clojure.

# purposes
I would like to understand the basics of implementing programming languages, and at the same time practice Clojure and TDD.

*This project is not suited for production use, it is only an exercise for me.*
